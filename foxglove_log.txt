    Fix WebSocket connections; allow URL.createObjectURL for worker CSP (#186)
    
    Add `blob:` to allowed sources for workers, since roslib uses URL.createObjectURL.
    
    There was an overly aggressive throw upon connection failure/disconnect, added during TS conversion, which caused a normally harmless `setPublishers([])` to crash.

    - `node --loader ts-node/esm --experimental-specifier-resolution=node` to make it so that ts-node can actually run the script with top-level await and resolve the `.ts` import

    The biggest change here is from an imperative `showNotificationModal()` function to a `<NotificationModal />` component that can be rendered. The backing implementation is the same (uses renderToBody) but now we can auto-cleanup when the component is unmounted.

    Fix PanelLayout, PanelList, and Tab stories (#149)
    
    The core problem was that globalConfig was not loaded in stories. Added a loader which does a similar thing to the main() function in our main index.ts.
    
    Also clean up some old logic around lazy importing of hooks, which we no longer have.

    Fix 3D panel circular import and Interaction stories (#146)
    
    The main problem here was a circular import that caused a component to be imported as `undefined`. I found a webpack plugin that can help us detect these—turned on warnings for now, but there are too many to fix currently. Also the plugin doesn't understand that our async imports are a valid way of breaking cycles (https://github.com/aackerman/circular-dependency-plugin/issues/67).
    One of the stories had a timing issue — I looked deeper for how to address this, but I think some problems stem from hacky use of `ref` as a way of detecting `onMount` in class components... ideally we would convert everything here to hooks, but that is too big a task for this PR, so just adding a band-aid on this story for now.
    
    I also found that the Layout stories pertain to enabling map height rendering for the Cruise internal map, so are irrelevant here (reverting part of https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz/commit/6eb6fd9c50b0691e9e5f501644c6957ac9d8d871).

    Fix ChildToggle state warning (#139)
    
    ChildToggle would setState inside its render function, which logged a React warning. I converted the component to use hooks and changed this to a useLayoutEffect so that it can still force an update after initial render (so that the ref gets hooked up) while no longer triggering a warning.
    
    Added uncontrolled mode with optional defaultIsOpen. This cleans up some use cases a little bit. Controlled mode is still quite common because many places want custom button styling when the dropdown is open.
    
    Also changes ContainsOpen to an onChange-style API rather than a render prop, and removes it from ImageCanvas where it wasn't really being used.

    I found that GlobalVariablesMenu was unused in the open-source webviz. It was easy to add to the top bar so I added it. While testing this I discovered that its animation was broken. Fixed by passing through className prop correctly. Also renamed AppMenu to AddPanelMenu which makes more sense.

    Some comments were moved around by flow-to-ts. Thanks to recent work in https://github.com/Khan/flow-to-ts/issues/230, running it again produced better results in some of these cases (although worse in others), so I manually pulled in a handful of useful changes to get us closer to the original comment formatting. I also fixed a couple things found using a project-wide grep.

    Make Storybook work (#123)
    
    All stories now build successfully! Some still look broken at runtime though — we have more cleanup work to do.
    - `yarn storybook` to open the storybook.
    - Use the beta version of storybook that's compatible with Webpack 5 (https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/13808)
      - Most of our main renderer webpack config can be shared with storybook.
    - Removed uses of `@dump247/storybook-state` and replace them with `useState` hooks.
    - Run `build:storybook` in CI so we don't break it.

    Use 100% of available CPUs for jest in CI (#111)
    
    The default is `#cores - 1`. But it's fine to use all the CPU in CI. https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html#--maxworkersnumstring
    
    In my tests, `--maxWorkers=2` (the number of CPUs) was fastest: https://github.com/foxglove/studio/runs/2015403773
    
    Also set job names to avoid breaking GitHub settings each time we change CI config.

    Fix app/dataProviders skipped tests (#76)
    
    Notes on MemoryCacheDataProvider Test:
    The test seemed to rely on some async-timing-sensitive logic. In reality because of the prefetching functionality, there is no guarantee that the provider will stop loading exactly at the 10th chunk. Accordingly, this change relaxes the test assertions.

    Fix debouncePromise test (#85)
    
    Some assumptions in this test were broken, likely due to the Node upgrade. Instead of `await Promise.resolve()` to allow the run loop to process async events, I updated the test to use specific signals for different events (such as the beginning of a function call, a promise returning, etc).

    Double click to un/maximize window [FG-86] (#28)
    
    It seemed like this should work by default according to electron/electron#15163, but it does not work, so add a custom double click event handler. Read system preferences to respect the user setting about whether the window should minimize or zoom.

    Set window background color (#27)
    
    Makes window resizing feel slightly less janky.
    
    I don't know why `exportOnlyLocals` is necessary here but not in webpack.renderer.config.js. In the renderer we are able to `import colors from 'colors.module.scss';` and it works fine, but when I tried that in the main process it imported as `{ locals: { ...colors... } }` instead of just `{ ...colors... }`.

    Set sideEffects: true for css imports so they are not optimized out [FG-68] (#25)
    
    CSS imports were being stripped during the build process. Marking them as `sideEffects: true` prevents the tree-shaking process from removing them.
    
    I'm guessing this was not a problem in the open-source version of webviz because it used webpack 3.x.

    Add warning about stuck extension installation (#24)
    
    I tried debugging why installation get stuck, including adding detailed logs, and observed that it may be getting stuck waiting for the `res.pipe` (used to download extensions to disk) to close. But once I added enough logs the problem stopped being reproducible, so I just gave up and added a warning.

    The only related issue I could find was MarshallOfSound/electron-devtools-installer#122 which claims it's a Win10 dark mode related problem, which clearly doesn't apply here.

    Separate preload build and add prefer-nullish-coalescing rule (#20)
    
    eslint config files are converted to yaml so that they don't get linted by eslint itself. With this new rule the eslint parser needs to know about the tsconfig.json, and these eslintrc.js files were not covered by any tsconfig.json, so they would throw an error when being linted.

    Remove allowJs from tsconfig
    
    allowJs breaks ts-loader since typescript cannot parse the flow files.
    If we override allowJs from ts-loader then we run into issues with missing
    module declarations for our js files. To be consistent we disable allowJs
    and use @ts-expect-error on the flow imports which we will remove as we convert
    the flow files to typescript.

    Change prettier to double quotes (prettier default).
    
    This matches the imported webviz style and generally results in
    fewer escaped string characters.
